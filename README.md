# Microsoft Intune Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Policy — ISO 27001 Aligned

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the configuration of Microsoft Intune's Attack Surface Reduction rules to improve an organisation's Microsoft Defender Secure Score, with direct mapping to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls.

## Why
Cloud posture improvement is a measurable, auditable way to prove ongoing security maturity. By implementing targeted ASR rules, I directly addressed top Secure Score recommendations while aligning with internationally recognised security controls.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Intune
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Azure Active Directory

## Process Overview
1. **Recorded Secure Score baseline** from Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
2. **Configured ASR rules in Intune** to address high-priority security gaps.
3. **Validated policy deployment** by confirming compliance in Intune and increased Secure Score.
4. **Mapped controls** to ISO 27001 Annex A for compliance demonstration.

## Key Improvements
- Secure Score increased from **44.4%** → **46.22%.
- Blocked potential malware delivery via USB, email, Office macros, and script-based attacks.
- Reduced attack surface against ransomware and phishing.
